Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
This repository provides a detailed explanation and implementation of an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), a critical component in digital systems and processors. The ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations on binary data and is an integral part of CPUs, microcontrollers, and FPGAs.

Overview
The Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) is a combinational circuit designed to perform:

Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, increment, and decrement.
Logic Operations: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR.
Shift Operations: Logical, arithmetic, and circular shifts (left and right).
Comparison: Equality, greater-than, less-than checks.
Key Features
Supports a configurable number of bits (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, etc.).
Modular design for scalability and reuse.
Performs a variety of operations based on a control signal.
Efficient design suitable for FPGA and ASIC implementations.
Block Diagram
The ALU comprises the following main components:

Arithmetic Unit: Handles operations like addition, subtraction, and shifts.
Logic Unit: Performs bitwise operations such as AND, OR, and XOR.
Multiplexer: Selects the desired operation based on control signals.
Flags: Provides additional information about the result, such as:
Zero (Z): Indicates if the output is zero.
Carry (C): Indicates an overflow in arithmetic operations.
Sign (S): Indicates if the result is negative.
Overflow (V): Indicates signed arithmetic overflow
